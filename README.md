# Bookster

A barebones CRUD app for rating and sharing books.

## The Story

This app was built for my Rails project with Flatiron School. It actually started as a bit of a joke with my wife, but turned into a project idea. I used ERB templates and minimal CSS styling to create a barebones book rating and sharing app. 

## The Tech

* Built entirely with Ruby on Rails using an MVC structure 
* Handled user Authentication using the Devise Gem and Facebook OAuth
* Styled using plain CSS and templated using ERB
